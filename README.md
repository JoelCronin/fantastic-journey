# Employee Database     

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I was asked to build a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) so that a company could easily perform CRUD tasks on their employee database. 

To do this I utilised Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL packages to enable the user to perform these tasks at the command line by answering pre-determined questions.
